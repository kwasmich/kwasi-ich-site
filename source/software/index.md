title: My software developments
---

Sometimes I write programs for my purposes, like calculation, simulation, visualisation and visual effects or automatisation. Depending on the challenge, C++, Java, AppleScript or JavaScript is utilised (XHTML, CSS and XML are **NOT** programming languages!). For visualisation I use OpenGL but sometimes I also use the Apple QuartzComposer for developing concepts.
